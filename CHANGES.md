# Change log for mac-scripts

## 2024-01-02

On advice of Caltech Library administrators, removed mention of Caltech in copyright statements. This also meant I had to change the license away from the Caltech-specific BSD 3-clause variant, so I took the opportunity to switch to the simpler MIT License.

## 2023-12-28

Created this separate repo for macOS-specific scripts and programs that I previously had in my [small-scripts](https://github.com/mhucka/small-scripts) repository.
